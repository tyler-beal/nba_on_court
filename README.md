# nba_on_court
This program was made to intake 3 .csv files:
  -General play by play
  -Player specific play by play
  -Rosters

The program will output which 10 players were on the court for each play.

I have also included a walk through of my code, a diagram of a system design around the code, and a walk through of that system design.
